# CPSC483Final

How to run:

Install libraries from requirements.txt.

Download Python Notebook and CSV and run script. Note that this is dummy data, as advised by Professor Ying (https://edstem.org/us/courses/64495/discussion/5884218). The results will be very poor at it is randomly generated data. I have not cleared my output from the actual run to show what the results would look like if I was able to share the data.
